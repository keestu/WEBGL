WEBGL Tutorials
Welcome to the WEBGL wiki!

The content of this tutorials is solely focussed on WEBGL along with GLmatrix 2.0. WEBGL utils from google is also being used. The tutorials focus on content, structure, ease of use, readability and memory allocation as it's top priority. As a whole WEBGL is a far cry from how easy context 2d in canvas was made but yet it has survived that with various game engines that has made life more easier. This is my approach to making a proper WEBGL demo.

a. Notepadplusplus_webGLLang.xml - Contains user defined language for webGL within notepad++ for readability.

  Usage:

    a. Within Notepad++ menu select "Language" --> "Define your language"
    b. Click the "Import" button and select the xml file.

b. Tutorial1 - Contains creation of traingle, cube (color and texture), square and pyramid structure.

c. Tutorial2 - Contains lighting of cube and restructured code for extensibility. Updated to facilitate multiple pocket contents of the same type.

d. Tutorial3 - Contains depth, blend options. Usage of keyboard events js present in commonjs. Single drawObject call with performance improvements and browser compatabilities. Addition of movable Camera based on keyboard events.

e. Tutorial Final - Leveraged AI in VS Code to cleanup and refactor code where required and thereby making it a cleaner Tutorial 3.
